# Tableau_Data_Profiling

### Objective:
Create a data profiling dashboard that allows a user to analyze the composition of thier data across the following areas:
- Uniqueness (see unique values, distinct values and duplicate values)
- Completeness (see populated values vs. null values)
- Value Distribution (see underlying data values that exist in a column) 

### File Glossary:
1. [Tableau Data Profiling Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob3101/viz/DataProfilingDashboard/Dashboard?publish=yes) - This link showcases the Tableau Data Profiling dasboard I have put together. Differnt columns can be profiled via the dropdown on the right of the report.

### FAQ:
- Unique Values = A count of the records that only occur once.
  - Ex. "Tableau has 5 unique letters, "T", "b", "l", "e", "u".
- Distinct Values = A count of the number of differnt records that occur, regardless of if a row as duplicate values.
  - Ex. "Tableau has 6 distinct letters, "T", "a", "b", "l", "e", "u".
- Duplicate Values = The number of occurences of non-unique records. Numerous NULL values are counted as duplicates.
  - Ex. "Tableau" has two duplicate records becuase "a" occurs twice.
